Business Problem

Electricity consumption data is generated in large volumes and stored in raw CSV files, making it difficult to analyze efficiently.
The organization lacks a structured system to transform this raw data into meaningful insights.
Business users are unable to easily track energy usage trends over time.
There is no clear way to compare consumption across households, regions, devices, or tariffs.
Manual analysis using spreadsheets is slow and error-prone.
The data does not follow an analytical model optimized for reporting.
There is no separation between fact data and descriptive dimensions.
As a result, answering basic business questions requires significant effort.
The organization needs a scalable solution for historical analysis.
Energy peak periods are not clearly identified.
Tariff impact on consumption cannot be evaluated effectively.
Regional and household comparisons are limited.
Decision-making is based on incomplete insights.
A centralized data warehouse is required to support BI tools.
This project aims to convert raw energy data into actionable business intelligence.
